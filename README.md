# Stalerz Isometric Game Engine (Pseudo-3D)
The Stalerz isometric game engine was an attempt at creating an HTML5 canvas-based tool for game developers to use. **The full project has been lost.** Only an old version could be recovered. It has been uploaded here as a portfolio piece. A demo of this old version can be found @

This older version of the software is imperfect and incomplete. It implemented the following:
- Tile rendering
- Map Dragging(Click and drag to move the map)
- Tile placement(Click to place down a block)

The lost version of the software implemented the following:
- Map rotation
- Map zoom
- Tile Deletion
- Infinite height ceiling
- Chunk loading for larger maps
- 2x1 tiles, 2x2 tiles, etc...
- Buildings(Rotation of buildings was never perfected)
- Pixel-perfect click detection
- Limited Mobile support
